## What is Laksa?
Laksa is a popular spicy noodle soup from the Peranakan cuisine, which is a fusion of Chinese and Malay culinary traditions. While many variations exist across Southeast Asia, Penang Laksa, or Asam Laksa, is particularly renowned for its rich, sour, and spicy fish-based broth, typically made with mackerel. It's infused with aromatic herbs like ginger flower (bunga kantan), mint, and lemongrass, and served with thick rice noodles, fresh vegetables, and often a dollop of pungent shrimp paste (hae ko) for an extra kick. It's a truly unforgettable taste of Malaysia!
